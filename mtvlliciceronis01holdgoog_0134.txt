1.11. ld] sc. favere nobilitati-imaginibus] ‘It was thecustom
for the sons or other lineal descendants oi those who had held curule
magistracies to make figures with waxen faces representing their dig·
nified ancestors, aud the right bestowed by such custom or usage was
called ius imaginum. These imagines or figures were usually ranged
in the public apartment (atrium) of the house occupied by therepre·
sentative of the family3 appropriate descriptive legeuds (tituli) were
attached to each; they were exhibited on all great family or gentile
festivals and solemnities; and the dignity oi a family and oi a gens
was, to a certain degree, estimated by the number which it could dis·
play. Ali persons who possessed one or more of these figures, i. e. all
who could number among their ancestors individuals who had held one
or more curule offices, were designated by the title oi nobiles. Those
who had no figures oi their ancestors but who had raised themselves to .
a curule office were termed noui homines. All who had no figures οἰ
their ancestors and had not, in their own persons, attained to a curule
office, were ranked together as ignobiles. Even aiter the admission oi
the Plebeians to a full participation in political power, the higher offices
were, to a great extent, monopolised by a small number ot' familios;
these nobiles became gradually more and more exclusive, and looked
with very jealous eyes upon every one not ,belonging to their own class
who sought to rise to eminence in the state. Hence the fierce oppo-
sition offered to Marius, who was a novus honio, and even Cicer0, who
stood in the same position, was always, notwithstanding the services he
rendered to the aristocracy, regarded with coldness and aversion by a
large portion of the old nobr'les. On the subject of Roman imagines
our great authority is Polybius vi 50) Ramsay Rom. Ant. p. 67.
