528. ln the period between the lex Cornelia of ac. 81,
when the iudicia were confined exclusively to the Senate, and the
lex Α urelia of ac. 70 we hear also of decuriae tudunum. We
do not know for certain upon what principle this arrangement
was founded, but it has been conjectured that the whole body of
iraiices was then divided into sections called decreriae, possibly
ten in number, each having from 35 to 40 members, and that
the decimae were called upon to serve in turn or that particular
decuriae were assigned to particular courts¹⁴⁷. The list of iudices
varied from year to year, and each decuria, after the exclusion
of those who were legally disqualified, was further reduced by
lot to 15, which number constituted a collegium iudicum. lf
there were any vacancies to be supplied in theconsilinm, caused
by the challenger, they were filled up by a process technically
termed subsortitio, because the presiding judge drew fresh names
from the urn. The same regulations seem to have applied
after the passing of the lex Aurelia to the other two bodies
admitted by it, viz. the equites and the aerarii tribuni. Each
of these orders also was divided into ten decuriae of 35-40,
the series from 1-10 was determined by lot, and the appoint-
ment of the decreriae composed of the three estates to try
the several lawsuits was made by the Praetor Urbanus. Thus
about 120 iudices, including those excused from serving, were
