jury (indices) so constituted for other actions: Sulpicius had
proposed that there should be for those of ambitus, but it
had been decided against him in lae. 63.

At the time of the trial of Plancius in nc 54 the arrange·
ment introduced by the lex Aurelia of Lucius Aurelius Cotta in
nc 70 was in force, according to which the juries were to con-
sist of three deeun'oe, taken in equal numbers from the three
orderS, the senators, the equites and the tributu aeran'ilss.
Up to the year ne. 123 the iudices, whether single jurynren
or a number of jurymen empanelled to serve either on the
standing or special commissions (quaestiones perpetuae or
extraordinariae), were taken exclusively from the Senate. ln
> that year the lex S em prouia iudiciaria of Gaius Gracchus
was passed which transferred the iudicia, ie. the right of
acting as jurors on crimina] trials, from the Senate to those
possessed of the census equester, who thenceforward constituted
the ordo equesterffl. The izeeiieia remained in their hands for
iorty-two years, until Sulla· in Β. c. 81 gave them back to the
senate. But the reaction consequent upon the death of the
Dictator rendered the continuance of this arrangement irn-
possible, accordingly in Β. c. 70 the law of L. Aurelius Cotta,
one of the praetors of that year, was passed, which ordained
that the z'uelices should be selected from the three orders, each
order forming a decuria. As the quaestiones perpetuae gradu-
ally carne to embrace all criminal causes, a certain number of
iudices were selected by the Praetor Urbanus for the whole
and distributed among the different quaestiones. The list for
the year was termed albeum tereticam, and the jurors were
technically designated iudiees selecti145. They amounted in
all from about 3>< 35o= 1050 to 3><400=120o
