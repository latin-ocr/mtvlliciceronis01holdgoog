Pompeius showed his gratitude to him by supporting him in his candi·
dature for the aedileship, in which, however, he was then unsuccessful,

he showed himself so strong a partisan of the Pompeian party, that his

enemies called him tuba belli c. (Fam. 6. ra). He was banished by Caesar,
but afterwards obtained his pardon through the intercession of Cicero, who
wrote him a letter on the occasion ep. ad fam. VI ra. W. Ramsay,
Dict. of Biogr. 1 p. 455.

based upon the claims of friendship; for I did not solicit in such a
manner as made it appear that 1 was canvassing for him, merely be-
cause he was a persona} friend or a neighbour or because I had always
beenon the most intimate terms with his father, but as for one who
might be said to be the saviour of my life. It was no influence of mine,
