CHAPTER XXXI

5 π, l. l. clamitas] ‘you declaim,’ §38 l. 4, a slur upon Lateren·
sis' style of speaking, cf. de or. 11 ao 586, 111 ai 581, clamatores
odiosi et molcsli, Brut. §182 ut intellegi possit, quem existimem clama·
torem, quem oratorem. .

quo usque ista Meis] reorum in te merita commemorando iudices
commovere studes, ut ea propter reos absolvant. w.

1. 8. nihii in cispio profecisti] ⁸ you derived no advantage from talio·
ing in this way in the case of Cispius! M. Cispius was tribune of the plebs
in uc. 57, the year of Cicero's restoration rom exile, when he took au
active part in Cicero’s favour, and on one occasion risked his life (or. p.
Sest. 5 76) for him. ln return for these services he was defended by
Cic. when prosecuted ior atabulus, but convictetl in spite of his advo-
cate's eloquence and tears. Cf. or. p. red. in S.§ ar quid M. Cispius?
cui ego iusi, parenti fratrique eius seirtr'o quantum debeam: qui, cum a
rue voluntas eorum iu privato iudicio esset offema publici mei beneficti
meruorio privatam <offensionem oblitterarent.

obsoletae] ‘worn out,’ ‘no longer of use!

1. 9. quam-detondi] ‘whose desenceiundertook by your persuasion,
just as it was from your testimony that l found out he had deserved so
well of me.'' On eodem cf. 5 54 l. 14, de ott. 1 §⁶32 584, and see Kenn.
Gr. p. 285, Madv. Gr. 5488.

ilo. metitum] sc. esse.

1. 11. et 01 dices oet.] ‘and arn I the man whom you will address
with the taunt quo usqua-I, whose exertions on Cispius’ behalf were,
you say, unavailingi' ei=mihi tali, and therefore contenderim not
contenderit is the correct reading, adopted by C. F. W. Miiller. ,

1. 12. nam tauns verbi eet] “for the import of your invidious
remark ‘how much longer' possibly might be this ε ‘One man has been
given up to you 3 another has been pardoned out of regard to you (spared
ior your sake); there is no end (to your begging ott friends), we cannot
put up with it any longer. For when a man has exerted himself for one
person in particular and has failed to obtain the very object of his
exertions, to have said to him ‘How much longeri' this looks more like
ridicule than rebuke.” The syllogism is ι ei dici potest ‘Quousque' qui
obtinuit. At ego non obtinui. Mihi igitur dici non potest ‘Quousque’
But, as Long observes, Laterensis did not mean this. He meant to say:
‘How long will you continue this kind of delence, when you see that it
does no good to your clients?” The seiton. AMBROS. have the follow·
ing note: ‘-unde quo minus impudens videretur haec compensativa
defensio, dicente Laterense, quousque vis servatos esse quos di·
ligis? et pro Cispio causam dicente sic rogasti et pre·
cibus tuis ambitum paene movisti, opposuit acutissimam re·
sponsionem merito haec ab eo dici potuisse, si pro illo impetrasset.
