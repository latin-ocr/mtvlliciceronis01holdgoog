1. ὖ. an Minturnenses -mirariuJ an goes with miraris, the anti·
thesis (Minturnenses coloni-versantur), which serves as a soil to bring
out the thought and which we should bring in as a subordinate clause
by ‘while’ ‘whereas' being coordinated as a main clause; just as in

Greek such antitheses are regularly introduced by μέν and δέ (Buttmann
Gr. Gr. p. 396 ed. 1833). See Madv. Gr. 5438, my n. to de osi. ι

‘or is it the case that, while the people of Minturnae are immortalised
ior adording shelter to Marius in his exile, you are surprised at Plancius
being honoured as he was sor the protection he accorded mei' ‘Iam
narratum a me hoc exemplum plenissime scio de C. Mario, qui Sullanis
armis cedens cum filio iu Minturnensium paludibus latuit. Inde emissus.
quoniam non potuisset occidi, navigio impositus in Africam pervectus

Minturnenses] the people of Minturnae, which was a city os
Latium, on the via Appia, on the right bank oi the Liris, on the hordeis
of an extensive marsh‚ about three miles srom the sea (Strab. v. p. a 3 3).
A colonia nearitinra with the rights os Roman citizens was established
there in mc. 296 (Liv. x ar, Vell. Pat. 1 14). In rac. 88 C. Marius,
when flying srom Rome by sea, was compelled to ut in at the mouth of
the Liris, and, endeavouring to conceal himse in the marshes, was
dragged from thence and imprisoned by order oi the magistrates of
Minturnae, who however afterwards released him and put him on
board a ship which conveyed him to Africa. Ci. or. p. Sest. ἓ 50 menri·
