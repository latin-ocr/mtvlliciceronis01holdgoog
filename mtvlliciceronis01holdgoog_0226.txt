1111. Calidium] ·Q. Calidius, father of the orator, was tr. pl. in
tac. 9p=a Μ. 655, and carried a law in this year for the recall of Q.
Metel us Numidicus from banishment‚ in gratitude for which theson
Metellus Pius, when consul, supported him in his candidature for the
praetorship. He was praetor urbanus in Μ. 717, praetor of Spain in
Μ. 78. 011 his return to Rome from his province he was accused in
the prenestr'o de repetundis by Q. Lollius and found guilty iu Μ. 77
(Vernl 538,113563).

Q. Metellus] Q. Caecilius Metellus C. f. Numidicus, the
most distinguished of the family of the Metelli, hence generally called
Metellus ille N. by Cic. as or. p. Sest. 5 130, or. p. Arch. 56, was consul
Μ. 109=ru Μ. 646 (Brut. 5 135) with M .Junius Silanus, when he con·
ducted the war against Jugurtha in Numidia, as he did also in the fol·
lowing years as proconsul, with success. On the cause of his return to Rome
before the conclusion of the war see Cic. de off. 111 5 79 with my note.
In Μ. 100 the demagogue Saturninus carried his agrarian law, which
contained a clause that the senate should swear obedience to its pro·
visions within five days after its enactment. Metellus refused to take
the oath, and, when Saturninus brought forward a bill to punish him
with exile, voluntarily quitted the city, rather than risk disturbances in it,
(cartineam legem, quam non iure rogatam iudicarat, iurare unus no·
luisset, de civitate 1111111ιί1 quam de sententia denroverz). On the death of
Saturninus and the consequent dissolution of his party very little oppo-
sition was offered to bis recall, which was proposed in Μ. 99, tribunicia

convictus impunis ex iudicio discedat. Sic etiam L. Opimius et
Q. Calidius propter sua iurem p. merita non id sunt consecuti, ut
