tribune of the plebs uc. 103, in which year he brought forward a law

, chiefly memorable for his statement that there were not 2000 meu of

property iu the state (de off. 11 ἓ 73 where see my note). In uc. 100
he wasone of those who took up arms against Saturninus. He was a
candidate for the consulship uc. 93 but defeated by Herennius (Brut.
ὅ 166, or. p. Mur. ἓ 36), consul uc. 91 with Sextus Julius Caesar, when
he distinguished himself by his opposition to the mensures of the tri·
bune M. Livius Drusus (above δ 33, de legg. 11 § 31, or. p. dom.§
41, 5 50), censor uc. 86 with M. Perperna. Cicero speaks very highly
of him in several passages, or. p. Mur. ἕ 36, p. Quinct. ς 71, Brut. ἓ 173
where as a speaker he is said to have summa libatas, urrellae suetiae,
and to besalis creber ire reperisrrdis, solutus iu explicantis seretavrtiis
(see n. on de off. 1 ἓ 108). He is the same as the Philippus of whom
Horace (Ep. 17, 46) tells the well-known anecdote.

with L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, being the first of his family to obtain
any curule office (or. p. Mur. ἕ 17, Verr. v§ 180). He was tribune of
the plebs uc. 107, when he proposed a lex tabellaria, which provided
thatin the courts of justice vutiug by ballot should apply to cases of
high treason also (perduellio), hitherto excepted from the operation of
the lex Cassio uc. 137 (Plin. ep. 111 acl. Irr the civilwar uc. 83 he

uc. 105, andin uc. 99 legatus under Q. Mucius Scaevola when pro·
consul of Asia. While acting in this capacity, by repressing the illegal
extortions of the tax-collectura (publicani) he incurred the hatred of the
equestrian body. Accordingly orr his return to Rome he was unjustly
arraigned of malversation (de repetundisl), found guilty and compelled to
withdraw into banishment in uc. 9² (Athenaeus rv. p. 168 Α παρὰ δὲ
