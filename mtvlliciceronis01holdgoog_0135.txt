CHAPTER VIII

510, 1. 15. mummulo anttqrurumo Tusculano] ‘The legend
which ascribes the foundation of Tusculum to Telegonus, the son of
Circe and Ulysses, is familiar to all readers of the Latin poets [feretroque
Telegoni montio celsa manu Ovid Fast. 111 91, Circaeo Τ uscnlo dorso

of the Latin league, from the fall of Alba to the battle of the lake
Regillus, Tusculum was the most prominent town in Latium. It
suffered, like the other towns in Latium, a complete eclipse during the
later Republic and the Imperial times.’ Burn Rome ond the Compogno

Tusculum was remarkable for the steadiness of its friendship for
Rome, which was only interrupted in lac. 379, when in consequence
of a number of Tusculans being found amongst the prisoners in the

Volscian campaign, war was declared and Camillus sent against the .

city. Cicero had a villa there (T usenlanntn) from which his Tusculan
disputations take their name.

(5 58), who united with M. Juventius Laterensis in accusing Cn. Plancius,
the first plebeian aedile was a member of this gens. Cicero denied the
correctness of the statement, but, true or not, the fact of its being made
is sufficient to prove the antiquity of the gens. The name does not
occur again in history till lae. 194 when T. Juventius Thalna was made
praetor ; and the first of the gens who obtained the consulship was
M. Juventius Thalna, who was the colleague of Tib. Sempronius
