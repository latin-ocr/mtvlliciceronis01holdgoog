“This edition ison much the same plan and is marked by the same com·
pleteness, as Dr Holden’s editions ot' Plutarclt....For more advanced students' it

is,1n all respects-grammatical‚ historical and critical, excellent: and it includes
ῗὲθῖηεύγεὶε 01 the subject·matter ot' the world-Journal ofEdmatbn, May,

“ Mr Holden’s name is in itselt' a uarantee ο1 the scholarship of this edition.
ln form little inore than a school boo (though avery elegant little volume and
an ornament to any library), it isin reality a handbook ο1 Attic Greek andos
history as resented in the lise and writings oi his author.”-Dublin Evening
Mail, Aprilo, 1887.

“Oi Dr Holden's cyropaedia I, II it is hardly necessary to speak. lt is,
like all Dr Holden's books, very learned, very full, very interesting and labori·
ously indexed”-The Guardtan, June 8, 1887.

“Dr Holden has done his part with characteristic thoroughness His Intro·
duction and notes are very t'ull and helpsul, and so is his running analysis.''-

“Within the memory of middle-aged men Xenophon's C yropaedeia was much
more read than it is now But as improved editions of the Antibaris multiplied,
the cympaedeim on which Xenophon doubtless prided himself much more than
he did on the Anamis, has been crowded out ot' the field aud we are glad to see
that Dr Holden has come to the rescue ot' a work ln which blenophon often appears
. at his best, as he seldom does tn the Anabasis. An elaborate introductron m which
contributions have been levied on the best and most recent authorities, abundant
references to Goodwin and Hadleyaud Allen in the commentary, valuable comments
on idiom and sphere ο1 use, a critical appendix and two indices, make this edition
oi Xenophon¹s Cyropaedeia, Books1 ιι (Cambridge, University Press, 1887)
worthy ο1 the companionship ot' the Hiero and the Oeconomicus by the same
Editor, and we are glad to learn from the preface that these two books are only
the precursors ot' acompleteeditiou.'¹-A merican Journal qsPltilology, Vol. vnt,
