proper return for his services to himself, with which he professes himself
well satisfied and that he had no need of Plancius’ further aid after
he had already saved his lise. Agaiu‚ how could he help showing his

recoruile their conflicting claims to his gratitudo, andfears he can scarcely
*shmv himself grateful to all at the same time. In the present case,
however, where the disparity is so great, his duty is plain: Laterensis
had but little to gain by sncceeding, he merely longed to efface his defeat
fior the aedileship, whereas Plancius would lose everything by conviction.
Laterensis ccznnot suppose that the court will bc prejudieed against Cicero
ou the ground of his crring on the side of excess in this gratitude, for if

persons likely to run the risk osa trial nor fimd of litigatiom it ought
not, says Cicero, to have any weight with the jurors to make them care
little about his gratitude, as if it could only be shown to those who needed
hisprosessional services. (ἓ ἸΨ-θ 02.)

Cicero replies‚ partly in jest‚ partly in earnest, to three trifliug im-
putations of Laterensis, (1) that he is toosond ef making pathetie
appeals to the jury, (o) of appearing as counscl in defmce, (3) os saying
smart things and making poor y'okes. (ἕ 88-86.) ⁴

C icero vindicates his hasty departure from Rome against the insinu-
ations of [utereresis. It was not the fcar of death which drove him into
exile, bnt the apprehension os civil war and of the trouble which might
have besallen patriotic citizens had he remairnd in Rome. He did not
wish to deprive the state of its mainstay nor the senate and people of
the opportunity of setting an euanque of a vegorous exercise of power
and display ofgratitude by his restoration from exile. (ἓ 80—§ 00.)

Laterensis taxes Cicero with having forfeited his liberty of adeon,
Cicero denies that he has. No one can blame him, he says, is hc has
regard sometimes for his oron safety, when he has done so mmh for the
safety of others. If he no longer opposes his former memus it does not
pellaeo that he deserves to be twitted with political inconsistency‚ because
he accommodata himself to the changing circumstances and conde’tsons of
society. . lhe good ef the state is the standard by which eumn semesam
