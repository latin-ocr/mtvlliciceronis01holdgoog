it should have cost him his life, and deplored the fatal step he
took in leaving Rome before he was directly impeached. His
letter addressed to Atticus (111 19) on the 16th oi September
is a living testimony os the, impatience and deep despondency
, which had laid hold on him. When his enemy Piso entered
on his province oi Macedonia, Thessalonice was no longer a
