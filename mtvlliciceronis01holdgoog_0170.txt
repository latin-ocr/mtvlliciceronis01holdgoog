were to try the case. In triols under all other honos, the jury eoas chosen
by lot from all ihe trahes, and both prosecutor and defendant were allowed
to challenge them (reicere). The senate in conserring this exceptwnal
power on the prosecutor supposed that he would he lehely to nanee the tribes
which the accrescd was suspected of having corrupted, in which case the
same parte'es would be ioth ws'tnesses andjnry. Now is the defendant's
own tribe or a tribe with which he was closely connected, was chosen
as one of the tribes to select the jury from, the defendant could not object.
But Laterensis, contrary to the intention of the senate in passing the laur,
did not choase the tribes with which Ploruius had intimate relations and
which he charged him with corrupting, hut others with which he had no
connexion whatever. What reasonable inference may be drawn from
this? either that Laterensis was guilty of such severity, as was not
contemplated by tholam, or else that he did not hele'eve that the two
trudes, which he decliued to nome, had been corrupted hy Plancius.
Plancius did much to merit the ‹afflctian of his peloro-tribesmen. He
helped thern in difficulties, and got places fior many of them through his
father’s influente: and surely it was never intended that the leges de
ambitushould put a stop to all those ordinary arts and expediente
by which populority ond influerne is secured in a marr’s ozon tribe.
Let Laterensis hut prove his case that Plancius corrupted the tribes by
means af sodalic1a‚ ond then I shall wonder why he did not use
the weapons provided for him hy the lex Licinia, why he did not name
Plancius’ aean trrhe and any other which he charges him with having
bribed. Plancius can show how he got the votes os the tribes which
noted for him quite as easily as Laterensis cars show how he himself
got the votes of any ‹ffthem (5 36-43).
