Ι 118 ’ PRO CN. PLANCIO [XX§49

CHAPTER XX

§5 49·-50· Boe! the election of Plancius ta the aedileshc'p wat
already a settled matter iu the Jiermer year, when the Comitia were
attempted ta bc held, bnt for sance reason pastpancd, when there was no
possibility af Plancius employing bribery and corruption, even if he had
thought os doing so, because so short a notice was given by the preseding
eofficm of the clectiou, and, as the vate of the centuria which uates first
determines the votes of those which caute after, so Plancius' prior electiore
arcade his second electiore sure. Τ hough laterensis, had he stooped to
make himsclspopular with the electars, mephat even theu, iu the interval
between the two electiores, have instunued them to votesor himself.

540, 1. aa. sed oar sto agot quan oet] we might also punc·
tuate thus: sea' cur sic ago quasi cet. We have an instance oi quasi
serving as a correlative to sic in de sen. ἕ 26 litteras Graecas-sic auide
amiani quasi diuturnam sitim explere cupe'cns; where ita would be
more usually employed. ‘Nesus orationis hic est,’ says Wunder,
‘conprobare Cicero c.x1x volebat, Plancium suffragia tribuum, quas
tulisset, non largitione devinxisse. Id nunc negat demonstrandum a
se esse propterea quod priora comitia, in quibus Plancius aedilis sit
designatae, eo modo sint habita, ut nullo pacto tribus corrumpi potu·
erint.

wmtttts superioribus] ‘Intellegentia sunt ea, quae a 699 Cn.
Pompeio 11 M. Licinio Crasso coss. haberi coepta, set propter obnun-
tiationem absoluta non sunt) w. See Intr. § 3.

1. 30. consol] M. Licinius Crassus, the very man who had
carried the lex Licinia de sodaliciis (ἓ 36), and who certainly would not
be likely to have connived at a breach oi his own law at the election
over which he himself presided.

consul—summa auctoritato] abl. description or characteristic oi
quality, Kenn. Gr. p. 399§ 153, Roby Gr. 11 ¹²3²·

t 31. habere coepta subito oen] ‘he determined so suddenly and
unexpectedly to hold the election that no one had time given him
to make the necessary provisions, even is he had thought oi bribing.'

1. 83. comparandi] ‘sor getting ready‚’ as in Liv. xxxv 45, 5 ut
Raneaui tarmus ad comparandum habeant, xL11 52, 8 fizllaci colloquio
extractam hiemem ut temptes ad comparandum haberent, Com. N ep.
Thrasyb. 11 a tempore ad comparandum dato.

r. 20, 1. 1. dinbltao whollao] ‘the votes were sorted,’ 5 ¹4 l. 25.
The word tabellae isa conjectural addition of Wunder's, adopted by
Baiter, Kayser, Hirschfelder. He objects to diribitae tribus in the
sense ‘the votes oi the tribes were distribuad! He proposes at the
same time to erase renuntiatae as a term inapplicable to tabellae and
because it disturbs the symmetry oi the sentence. See 5 14 l. 26.
