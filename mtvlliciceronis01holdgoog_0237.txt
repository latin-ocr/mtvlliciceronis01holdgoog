1. 82. 1..1sact11] Lucius Racilius was a warm supportet oi
Cicero. He was tribune oi the plebs in tac. 57=A.u.c. 697, with Cn.
Plancius as his colleague. He took part in the disorders which arose
when Clodius, accused byMilo dcvi, sought to get rid oi the charge by
becoming a candidate ior the aedileship. The question was debated in
the senate, and in the iorum sought to be decided by open iorce, whether
the trial should come on first or the election oi aediles, or vace verra.
Milo had now retired into private lile: the consuls were gone to their
provinces; P. Rutilius Lupus, a tribune of the people‚ summoned a
meeting of the senate: only about coo members attended. Racilius
renewed the debate about Milo’s impeachment of Clodius, and called
upon ¹Lentulus Marcellinus the consul designate to give his opinion
lltlltllhtltttti tlt hiltl‘tltlt‘.{lulltlutiuittht
that if any one attempted to hinder the trial, he should be deemed a
public enemy. The tribunes C. Cato and C. Cassius spoke against it,
and were for proceeding to an election before any step towards a trial.
L. Philippus, the other consul elect, was ol the same mind as his col·
league, and Cic. being called upon to spealr denounced Clodius; he
was followed by others. Clodius began to spealr with the intention oi
wasting the rest of the day (diem ductario eximere coepit); the rabble oi
his iollowers outside expressed their opinions so loudly, that the senate
broke up in a hurty. ln the· civil war Racilius espoused Caesar's
necesitateresumunt acue
governor oi that province, by whom he was put to death witu the rest

oi the conspirators (Bell. Alex. 52, 55).
