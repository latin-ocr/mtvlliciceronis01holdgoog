xxxviii INTRODUCTION

the punishment already applicable to cases of ves: and also in
order that he might bring the defendant before an extraordinary
tribunal, the iudices editicicssa court employed only in cases of
res tribunrro, and which could not take cognizance of any other,
even of ambitus. And when then, in spite of this, Cicero speaks
of M. Licinius Crassus as trorum ipsarum legum ambitus
auctor i. e. as the author of these decrees against ouzbituslil,
he cannot mean any kind of ambitus but that practised by such
sodales and sequestres.

’ 526. For the lex Licinio de sodaliciis expressly forbade, as

is shown by the above passages, the association of sodales, the
formation and organisation of clubs iu pursuit of political ends ;

it forbade canvassing and registen'ng (conscribere) men in the
several tribes and subdividing those who belonged to the same
tribus into bodies of ten (decurtare), and in like manner mark-
ing out the several tribes into districts (populum dhertbere); it
forbade the employment of sequestres or intermediaries for
holding deposit-money, the promising of money (pronuntiare),
the doling it out (dc'atdere) and the sale to others of votes
obtained by bribery140.

According to Cicero not one of these offences could be
proved against Plancius. He had, it is true, like all candidateS,
canvassed the people by tribes (tributim)¹4¹, but that was no
offence against lave. He had, it is true, his friends, but to de-
signate those by the name of sodales would be to slander a pure
aud honourable friendshipm. He was, it is true, popular and
influential, but that was no reason why he should be suspected
of electioneering intrigues. If others had worked by means of
clubs in the interest of Plancius, it was they, not PlanciuS, who
should be impeached.
