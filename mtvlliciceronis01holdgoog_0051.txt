Cicero obtained his client's acquittal. But we have no ancient
authority for this assertion. There is the evidence indeed ol

Cicero himself in two letters addressed to him ¹⁰⁰ that he was ·

living at Corcyra, in lac. 46 and it is assumed that he was
living there in exile because of Caesars eumity towards him as
a partisan of Cn. Pompeius; but this is mere assumption, as
there is nothing to show why Cn. Plancius was living out of

Italy, whether in consequence of his conviction or lor other
reasons.
