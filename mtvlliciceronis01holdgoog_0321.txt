from the high level of the others is discernible. Here again is the same careful
scholarship, the same lavish learning, the same knowledge of the Greek lan·
guage in every period of its existence, so long as there are any authors in it
worth reading. And what life of any hero of history or romanoe is more
fascinating than that of Timoleon, es ecially as portrayed by the flattering

life is in fact a romanoe, and, with all allowance for the colours which the Greek
historiens were too lrable to lay on over-freely, rt is a romanoe which is true.
Dr Holden's Introduction deals wrth the sources used by Plutarch; it is an
admirable essay on the subject, incidentally treating many interesting historical
questions. It should be carefully read by all who intend to study Plutarch's
account, The notes and indices are beyond prarse; nothing can be wanted
further. -Journal qsEducatwn, July 1, 1890.

“We have a masterly Introduction, dealing with the primary sources of
information for the Life of Timoleon accessible to Plutarch,...then with the
” secondary sources....A map of Sicily, a chronological table of events in that
island, and a map of Syracuse find a place between the Introduction and the
Text. The notes, it is needless to say, exhibit sound scholarship and afford the
student inst that aid which he requires, and enable him to perfectly grasp the
style of Plutarch, of which the Life qs Timoleon isan easy and lucrd example.
A critical Appendix, several Indices and a raiseworthy Lexical Index to the
Life, bring us to the end of a work which wiliinerease the high reputation of the
author.''-Educational Times, Dec r, 1889.

“We need not characterize this work any further than by saying that it
resembles its Editor¹s other editions of Plutarch....The scholarship and eruditlun
are of an extremely high order.”-Guardian, Jan. 8, 1890.

“This is a perfect edition of a most interesting work....It is brought out in
such a style that it is a pleasure to handle and to look at it.''-Dublin E occing
Mat'l, Nov. ao, 1889.

“On the same lines and executed with the same admirable thoroughness as
this scholar's former editions of other ‘Lives' for the Cambridge University
Press....Both Greek scholars and teachers of Greek will be grateful to Dr Holden
for this fine new ‘Plutarch' which in every respect confirms its editor's reputa·
tion.'’-Scotsman, Nov. ιθ, 1889.

“Dr Holden has edited the lives of Themistocles Nikias, the Gracchi, and
Sulla, in a manner which has received hi h commendation in America, France
end German , as well as in England. he companion volume which has 'ust
been issued ias all the merits of its predecessor, exhibitio sound scholarsiip
sobriety of Judgment and the¹ most unweaned industry. ‘rie thoroughness and
completeness of the work will be seen from a mere statement of its contenta...
It is a book for which the thanks of all lovers of classical literature are due both
txplDr Holden and to the Cambridge University Press.'¹-Classicrrl Revr'ew,

o. w. pp. 22-25.

“A more completely edited volume for higher School and College use than
the present it is impossible to conceive....It is an unusually solid piece of work.
The hook should be acceptable as an inducement to a course of study out of the
traditional rut of Greek reading.'’-Glasgow Herald, Dec. 3, 188<y

“We have here another of those singularly com lete pieces of work of which
Dr Holden has, in recent ears, givensomanytotife world. It seems tobehis
plan to take amoderatef short text, to lavrsh on it all the 'resources of a
scholarship such as fewe itors can match, and to make the edition complete by
placing within its covers ever thing which is needed for the translation under·
standing, and appreciation of the author. The purchaser of one of Dr iiolden's
books need not look outside for any sort of help.'’-Academy, Oct 18, rdoo.
