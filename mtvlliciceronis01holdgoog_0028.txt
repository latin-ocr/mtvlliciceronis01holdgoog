ἕ 11. The election to State offices (bonores) was carried
chiefly through the votes os the candidate's own tribus. It was
the object therefore οἱ himself and his friends to secure the votes
of this and oi as many as they could of the remaining 34⁷⁵.
Accordingly Cicero by his recommendation of Plancius made a
zealous effort to win the tribes to his side⁷t The same was
done by others ior their friendS, as by Caesar and by Clodiust.
Besides such recommendations, the candidate’s friends husied
themselves in obtaining votes ior him hy giving public ban· «
quets to the tribes (convivia tm‘butim data)⁷⁸, by assigning re-
served places to the tribules at the gladiatorial and other shows
(spectacula tributim datu)⁷⁹. To obtain the votes of a tribe for
a friend by these and such means was called tribum conficere.
They were crimina] if employed not tributim but uulgo tri-
butim, that is, among the whole people in their 35 tribes.

ς 12. When a man had a number οἱ tribes in his favour,
he might increase that number by coalition with another candi-
date so as to unite their interests, in order to throw out a third
who was likely to prove formidable to either singly. This was
called tribum conferre or concederem. Thus, if one of the two
candidates had nine tribes and the other as many other tribes,
by forming a coalition (coitio) both candidates together might
secure 18 and so an absolute majority of the whole 35 tribes
· Cicero himself held this to be a periectly legal method of elec-
tioneering, and assisted at such coalitions himself, as may be
inferred from a letter to his brother Quintusffl. Other evi-
’ dences oi coalition are given by Asconius in his commentary
on Cicero’s speech in toga candidat, which was directed against,
