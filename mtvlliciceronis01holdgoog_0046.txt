nominated as liable to sit upon a particular quaestio, and this
number was reduced by ballot (sortitio) and by reiectio, ie. the
challenging of thern permitted to each of the contending parties,
to an aggregate of 75 at most or 2 5 out of each estate.

The voting of the iudices was originally open, but aster the
passing os the bill of L. Cassius Longius Ranilla (lex
Cassia rebellantem) in ac. 137 it was conducted in secret by
ballot (per labellus), each juror depositing his tubello in one ol
three boxes (sitella) according to the estate to which he belonged
in pursuance of the lex Fufio iudiciariam. lt was necessary
that at least two-thirdsstof the iudices should be present and
vote.

529. Besides these enactments the bill of P. Vatinius
(lex Vatinia de alternis consiliis reiciendis) was still valid in
Μ 54, by which according to Ernesti and others the accused
(reus) in a trial could challenge (reicere) all the iudices and core-
silia once and the prosecutor-(accusator) could do the same-the
previous practice having been that each party, prosecutor and
defendant, could only challenge a certain number ol the con-
silium, the places of those who were challenged being supplied
by the praetor's subsortitio. But C. T. Zumpt supposes that

this law allowed either party to challenge the consilia once and
that on this being done a new consilium was appointed: but
that it did not allow the whole consilium to be challenged
twice, as Ernesti supposed, first by the accused and then by the
prosecutor.
