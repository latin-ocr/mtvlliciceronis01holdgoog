' tm. meminerim-recorder] meminisse, like μεμνῆσθαι, denotes ‘re-
membranoe’ as a state of mind, to retain something in memory without
ever having forgotten it: reminisci and recordari, as an aet of the mind,
to bring to one's mind again something which had been driven out of
one’s thoughts, recordari ‘to bethink one’s self of,’ ‘lay to heart,' ‘to
‹lwell in memory upon,' as the result of reminisci, ‘the recalling it to
memory,' or. p. Ligar. 5 35 sed parum est me lenc meminisse ,· spmo

Q. Fabius Maximus Allobrogicus (Brut. 5 187) took the lead in the
proceedings which ended in the murder of Gaius Gracchus, Philipp. v111
14, Cat. 154, or. part. 30, 104, 106. In isc. rao he was accused by
Q. Decius, tribune of the plebs, of having put Roman citizens to death
without a trial, defended hythe consul C. Papirius Carbo (qui nihil de
C. Gracchi nece negabat sed id iure pro salute patriae factum esse de'cebut,
de or. 11 5106). and acquitted. He was condemned however 11 years
afterwards under the bill of C. Mamilius Limetanus for enquiring into
the conduct of all those who had received bribes from Jugurtha (he had
been sent with others 10 divide the dominions of Micipsa between Ju·
gurtha and Adherbal), and went into exile to Dyrrhachium, where he
died (sciron. 11011. p. 311, or. iu Pis. 595, or. p. Sest. 5140, de orat. 11
5 106, or. in Cat. 11 5 4, Brut. 128). Cic, as a member 01 the optimate
party, frequently laments the fate 01 Opimius (or. p. Sest. 5 140), bnt
undeservedly, for he and his party nbused their victory most savagely.
According to Mommsen he was the true model of a Roman aristocrat.
