xviii INTRODUCTION

in the second consulship os Pompeius and Crassus, he became
a candidate t'or the aedileship sor the following year, rso 54
It has been already stated (p. xv) that the electioris were not
completed in this year*⁴ but postponed till the following in
consequence os some protest. His competitors were A. Plo·
t·ius⁴⁶‚ Q. Pedius and M. Juventius Laterensis& he was
elected together with A. Plotius to hold the public games, as
curule aedile⁴⁷, sor the remainder of the year. At his election
he was supported by the hearty co-operation os his friends and
'townsmen3 the friendship os Cicero and the social influence of
his father were also a considerable help to him. The two
tribes T erelina⁴⁸ and Voltinia⁴⁰ were interested in his behalf
because of his birthplace. lt was not surprising that Laterensis
sailed, sor relying on his high birth and social rank he had taken
little or no trouble to secure his election. At first C. Plancius,
it appears, wished sor him as his colleague in the aedileship‚
since at the first comitia in ue. 55 he seems to have obtained
sor him the votes οἱ the tribes that were friendly to himself.
But owing to the indifference shown by Laterensis in his canvass

’ Cn. Plancius abandoned all hope of serving him, and as he ran

the rislr of losing his own election by supporting such an un-
popular rival, he effected a coalition with A. Plotius at the
second comitia and was ultimately chosen aedile with himw.
