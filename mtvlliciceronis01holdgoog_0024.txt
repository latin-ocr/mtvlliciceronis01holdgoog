INTRODUCTION xix

he exhibited games at Praenesteffl, and afterwards served as
proquaestor in Cyrene. In lte. 59 he became a candidate⁴ for
the tribuneship‚ but withdrew from his candidateship‚ amiel the
applause of the conservative party, because he refused in his
candidatorial speech (oratio in toga candida)⁶⁷ to bind himself
by an oath prescribed to all magistrates to observe Caesars
law⁵⁸ respecting the distribution of the public land in Campania.
He was denouueed by L. Vettius in rac„ 59 as an accessory and
privy to a conspiracy against Gnaeus Pompeius⁵⁰‚ and he ac-

lte. 58, Laterensis felt awarm sympathy for him⁶⁰ and showed
himself generally a zealous and uncompromising member of
the optimate party. His partisanship made him unpopular and
his democratic adversaries watched their opportunity to raise
suspicion against him In his dissatisfaction at the course of
events he withdrew from public life and was consequently for-
gotten even by the members of his own party. When then

in lto 55 and 54, in the second consulship of Pompeius and

Crassus,he became a candidate for the curule aedileship, he could
not fail to perceive that he had little or no chance of successffl.
Plancius wished for him as a colleague‚ until he saw that his own
prospects might possibly be injured by his support of Laterensis.
It was not until the year 51 tac, that he recovered lost ground
and obtained sufficient popularity to be elected praetorffl.

He appears once more in history as a legatus in the ,

army of M. Aemilius Lepidus, governor of the provinces of
Hispania citerior and Gallia Cisalpina in ΒΩ 43. When An·
tonius came to Gaul after the battle of Mutina, Laterensis tried in
vain to confirm Lepidus in his allegiance to the senate ; and, as
soon as Lepidus threw open the gates of the camp to the victor,
