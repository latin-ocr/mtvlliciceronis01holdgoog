xxx INTRODUCTION

Another provision of the lex Tullia was that the accused
should not be allowed to deser or adjourn the trial on the plea
oi illness, but that it should be continued without interruption
until terminated ¹¹⁰.

ἓ 18. The lex Tullia, however, was not more efficacious in
quelling the spirit oi corruption than any previous enactments.
We still hear ol large sums being spent upon elections. Cicero
in one of his letters to Atticus1¹1 mentions two decrees os the
senate being passed in Β. c. 61, at the instance ol M. Cato and
Domitius, to check certain electioneering abuses; one autho·
rising search of the houses oi magistrates who were suspected
oi having bribery money deposited with them; another ordain-
ing that any magistrate, in whose house bribery agents were
harboured, should he held guilty os a state offence. There is
mention in the same letter of a bill proposed by the tr. pl.
Aufidius Lurco, that the mere promise oi money to the
tribes sor their votes without payment should not be punish-
able, but that the actual payment of it should be punished by a
heavy finem. The proposed bill, however, was not passed

These enactments os the lex Tullia and the two senatus
consulta oi the year Β. c. 61 were still in fult force, when Cicero
delivered his* speech in favour os Plancius. It isos them he
speaks in §44¹¹³, and Laterensis also referred to them in his
indictment.

ς 19· A second mode of ambitus was by means of clubs or
associations (sodalicz'a). Gnaeus Plancius was charged by
M. Juventius Laterensis with having procured his aedileship
through the intrigues of such associations. Cicero’s ob'ect is to

prove that the cesharg brmtghtagainstQ in reality
