APPENDlX ΟΝ THE TEXT

A. General Remarks

The text ol this edition oi the Planaana is founded mainly upon
that of C. l'. W. Miiller as given in v01. 111 Part ιι oi the excel ent
edition of Cicero's works in the Bibliotheca Teubneriana, raso-so.
‘Miiller’s text is based upon two principat uss: one (τ) lrom the
monastery of Tegernsee in Bavaria, now in the library of Munich
(cod. Lat. 18787), first collated lor Garatoni. lt was lost sight oi lor
hals a century, but luckily lell into the hands ol Baiter¹, who bought it
from aboolrseller in Paris, whither it is said to have been taken from
Hungary. lt is probably not earlier than the rrth century. (Α speci·
men page oi this its is given by Chatelain in his Ibldograplrie der
classiques latins, Pl. xxvn). The second (fl) was formerly at Ert'urt‚
and is now at Berlin. Both are derived apparently lroru one and the
same original, which was corrupt and inte lated. Thus in ch. >1526
Ι alone preserves the true reading ciciliae, all the other nass have

civili errore, and in ch. xxxiv ξ 83 all urss present the faulty reading ex
illo arrrbilu traxisse, lor exsilio anrbitum sanxisse.

There are twenty-seur urss besides these which have been accurately.
and nine which have been inaccuratelycollated3 ot' the former Laurenti-

anus tertius (lc), the third of those ο the Medici Library at Florenoe, is
pronounced by Wunder to be the best, as it agrees more osten than any
other with 'l' and fl. None appear to be older than the 15th century.
and they are all incomparably interior to 'l' and ΙΙ. Wunder points out
that there are only two passages in the whole speech, in which any one
citheni gives the right reading where 'l' aud Ι have a corrupt one, viz.
5 47 where the latter have nam lor iam, and ἕ 95, in quo lor quod.

The most ancient Commentary on the Text is contained in a solio
now in the Ambrosian Library nt Milan, to which it was brou ht
from the famous monastery oi St Columba at Bobio about the ·
ginning ol the 7th century. It is a codex rescriptas or palimpsest (the
superinduced ars containinga Latin translation os a portion oi the Acts
