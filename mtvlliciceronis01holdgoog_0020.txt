INYRODUCTION xv

Alter this oration Cicero at the request of Cn. Pompeius de-
fended L Cornelius Balbus, a native ol Gades, on a charge
os exercising theRoman franchise illegally.

ξ 3. The year 55 lac. (=699 huc.) opened with great
disturbance. The elections still continued to be interrupted,
so that it became necessary to appoint an Interrex‚ and it was
only at the conclusion of the first quarter that Cn. Pompeius
Magnus aud M. Licinius Crassus, consuls each for the
second time, were able to enter upon the duties of their office.
While the tribune of the plebs Gaius Trebonius proposed his
bill to the popular assembly (lex T rebonia) that the consular
provinces, syria and the two Spains, should be held sor five
years, and also that Caesar's administration of his province
should be prolonged for another five years, Cicero, yielding
passively to the stream of events, had retired to his Puteolan
villam, where he commenced his three books de Oratorem,
aud came back to Rome only to reply to the insulting speech
which Piso addressed to the senate in answer to the charges
Cicero had made against him. Crassus carried his lex de so·
deliciis26 through and quitted Rome sor his province Syria
before the expiration ol his office and without providing sor the
elections of the next year. An election os aediles sor the year
lac⁴ 54, which should have taken place under his presidency,
had not been heldil, and no other magistrates sor that year
were chosen except the consuls Ι, Domitius Ahenobarbus and
Appius Claudius Pulcher, and even their election was deferred
till the close of the year tac 55. The aediles for the year tae.
54 most therefore have been elected in that same year and per·
haps in the beginning of the second hall of it, because Plancius ,
was accused before he entered on his office, certainly after
P. Vatinius, whose trial did not take place until July. We may
conclude then that Plancius and Plotius were chosen in the
