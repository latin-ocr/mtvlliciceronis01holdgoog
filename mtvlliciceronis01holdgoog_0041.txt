xxxvi INTRODUCTION

reckoned As sodalicius is an adjectivem, the full title is
collegia sodalicia, as it appears in inscriptions and in the
Digestsffl. They were really a revival of the sodalitates in
another form. In so far as they were associations of members
of tribes for the pursuit of a definite object, they were collegia.
But as they resembled the original sodalitates in the support
which their members afforded to each other in the courts of
justice, in popular assemblies and at electioris, these collegia
were sadalicia. Thus they were political clubs within the tribus,
founded often by the candidates themselves, as by P. Clodius
in B.c. 58. Their principal, it not their only, aim wasto or-
ganise and retain in their own hands a system of bribery¹³³, so
as, if possible, to divert any charge of ambitus from the candi-
dates to themselveS, trusting to their numbers to afford them
security. So the old evil reappeared in a new form. Hence
such a collegium is called¹³⁴ a consensio qrcac stragis borceste
qccam uere sodalitas nominatur, because it is not really a
sodalitas in the primary sense of the word. But since each
. member of a collegium sodalicium may be also spoken of as a
sodalis, we find Cicero in ξ 46 saying cupidos et gratiosos-tu
si sodalis uocas, officiosam anciciicam nominc inquinas cri-
ruinoso.

ξ 24 The crimen sodalicii, therefore, which formed the acte
d'accusaiiou of Gnaeus Plancius, was for the organisation of
clubs in order to exercise undue influence over the electionsffl.
But LaterensiS, in order to gain his cause, must prove, which he
failed to do, these facts :—Plancium decuriasse, conscribsisse,
sequestrem sciisse, pronunciasse, dicatae, that he had planned
a decuriatio tribulium and a diremptio papuli.
