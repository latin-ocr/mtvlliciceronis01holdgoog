PREFACE

Tun Planciano is not included in any English edition of
select orations of Cicero, nor has any separate edition ol it
ever been published with English notes. And yet it must be
regarded as one of Cicero's best, is not so choice a specimen
of formal perfection as the limentana, or ol such historical
importance as the Vern'ncs or Catiltizarians. ‘There is no
tearing os any enemy to tatters,' as Mr Anthony Trollope
well remarks in his Lffe os Celere, ‘but therelis much pathos
and a lew passages in it of peculiur force' Such are the
orator’s lively comments on the caprice of the people in
their appointment ol magistrates, on the relation between
a candidate foroffice and his electors‚ and on the arts of ‘
electioneering3 on the use of the ballot3 on political con-
sistency: such is the famous comparison between the
pecuniae debitio et gratt'uc, and such again the beautiful
irony with which he ridicules the pretensions os the pro· ’
secutor,

It is the more surprising then, that while other speeches
of Cicero have been edited and re-edited, this has lain in
comparative neglect Wunder's edition, ‘which’ it has
been said ‘may safely be pronounced to be the most
elaborate, if not the ablest‚ edition of any of Cicero's
works‚' has been long out of print, and Kbphe's is prac-
tically useless, the notes being written in German. No
apology therefore seems to be needed lor the publication
os a new edition with English notes for the use of students
at the University and for boys at public schools
