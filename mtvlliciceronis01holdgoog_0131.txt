1. 14. mue] sc. dictu, ‘an offensive way 01 putting it, He (Plau-
cius) is more deserving than the other (Laterensis),’

quomodo 0111 asamar] sc. dictu: ‘what is the lairer way 01 putting
iti’ This is, 1 take it: 101 here lies the point, this is enough 101 the
judge, ‘he was elected.’ ‘Why your client rather than myself?' I do
not know or 1 don’t choose to say, or lastly I might say ‘he was not
properly elected:’ which would be a very disagreeable assertion to
make, though I ought not to be punished 101 making it!

115. quod autur] de Div. 1 86 cur-fiat quidque, qrcaeris. Recte
omuino; sednon nunc id agi tur ; fiat necue, 111 qemeritur.

1. 11, quod 1111111 menusanum esset-non reate] gravissimum erat
Ciceroni, si dicebat non recte Plancium Laterensi esse praepositum, ex
quo consequi videbatur, ut Plancium largitione populum corrupisse con·
cederet. Tamen negat se, si hoc diceret, debere puniri, id est, causam
Planci perdere existumari, cum populus, id quod supra docuit, sine iu·
dicio magistratus creare soleat, ideoque ex eo, quod quis non recte sit
iactus, minume sequatur, ut largitione corrupisse populum censendus sit,
cumque populi factum licet non probandum tamen ferendum sit. W.

l. 18. num quid adsequerere] By pointing with acomma at recte
and reading num 101 the vulgate 11111, Landgraf, who adopts Gruter's
correction adsequerere, has cleared up the difficulty 01 this passage.
The sense is: ‘You ask me, why was your client preferred by the
electors to me? I do not know, or I do not choose to say, or supposing
l did say, what 1 should very much dislike saying, though I might do
so without compromising my client's case, viz. that the people made the
wrong choico, acted capriciously, what object should I attain by the
admissionis I were to take such an extreme line 01 delencel' Extrema
defensio is to be explained by the preceding words vel denique, quoa'
mihi gravissimum esset, si dicerem· For an explanation 01 the ntss
reading adsequerer, retained by Wunder, Miiller and others, see critical
notes.

ἐξ tn-ao. But this r's not all ,· without canapariae your respective
persoual mere'ts I can justisy the people’s choice of Plancius 11111
prove that hc did not eucploy unacorthy expediente to carry his electiou,
hut avae'led himself of the ordinary avenucs 11 office which are open to
theson of 1 Roman hnrght. The other candedata Plotius and Pedius
were also sons ιγ’ Roman knights. Why be augry with Plancius rather
than with the 1111 who was immediately above you iu the poll? (ἓξ 17, 18).
Your high ranh was no doubt in your fravaur, andyou think it ought to
have secured your electiore: no doubt there are many who priae high
rank, hut it e's na fault of aurs if there are many more who do 1111.
