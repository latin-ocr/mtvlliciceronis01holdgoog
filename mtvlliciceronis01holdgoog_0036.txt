this oration no less than from the fact that the tribunals for
trying the two offences were distinct, that the same person
could be tried sor each separatelyffi, and lastly that, whereas
unsuccessful candidates could be punished for ambitus¹¹⁶, lor
sedatum only those actually elected were punishable.

ordinary ambitus.

The right os combination in common pursuance os common
aims was not restricted in Roman law. There was no enact·
ment abolishing this right in a general way, sor the laws
usually cited to prove the contrary apply to nightly assemblages
and gatherings, to popular meetings not presided over by a
magistrate, or to specially·named unions, as the law against
the Bacchanalia: indeed the xii tables contained, according to
Gaius, a clause permitting assemblages in cases where no
existing decree was iniringed by them. Thus arose the sociali-
