Catoni, homini agrino et reovo, qua omnes quasi exmplari ael indus·
triam uirtutemque ducimur, certe licuit Tusculi se in atio delectare
salubri et propinqua loca). He passed the earlier years of his life in
parsimonia atque in duritia atque industria, agro colendo, saxis Sabi-
nis silicibus repastinandis atque conserendis (F est. p. 281). He entered
the army as a common (ordinarius) soldier about the time of the battle
of lake Trasimenus, but subsequently served as military tribune under
Marcellus in Sicily, under Fabius at the capture oi Tarentum ac. 209
(de sen. ἕ ιο), and under C. Claudius Nero at the battle of the Metau-
rus. In ue. 204, at the age of thirty, he began his political career
with the quaestorship, and served under Scipio Africanus in Sicily and
Africa, but their habits and views of lile differed so much that he was
allowed to retum to Rome. In ac. 199 Cato was plebeian aedile, in
s. c. 198 he was chosen praetor and obtained the province of Sardinia,
which he mled with the strictest economy and justice. In Β. c. 195 he
was elected consul with L. Valerius Flaccus, being the first navus horna
elected since C. Flaminius the consul of uc. 217 carried on a success·
ful warin his province Hispania citerior and triumphed on his return.
When the war against Antiochus broke out he served on the staff of the
consul M’. Acilius Glabrio as legatus consularis (Liv. xxxw 17, ι) or,
according to Cic. de sen. ἓ ro, as tribunus militum, and the decisive
victory of the battle of Thermopylae, by which Antiochus was driven
out of Greece, was mainly owing to him. From this timebis military
career ended ; and for the next sorty years he was the leading figure on

the stage os Roman politics, distinguishing himself by his vehement ·

opposition to the Roman nobles, especially the Scipios. ln ac. 184 he
was censor with his old friend Flaccus, but all his struggles against the
, degeneracy and luxury os the times during his tenure of this office
proved unavailing. His lise-long prejudice against Carthago is well
known, and how he always ended his speech, whatever was the subject,
with ‘ceterum censeo dclmdarn esse Carthaginem! He died uc. ¹⁴9
before the conclusion of the war. Cato enriched the Latin language
with several literary works. His a'e re rustica is a miscellany of maxims
relating to domestic and rural economy: his ἀποφθέγματα (Cic. de off.
15104, de orat. 115 ηπ) is a collection oi witty sayings srorn Greek
and Roman sources We have also fragments of some of his speeches,
the titles of ninety of which are still known. His greatest work, how·
ever, was the Origines, the first historical work in Latin, many frag-
ments of which are extant (5661. 16). His antipathy to the Greeks
and their literature showed itself in various acts, as when he urged the
removal of the famous embassy from Athens in ac. ¹53· There is a
splendid and celebrated portrait of him in Livy xxxix 40. His bio-
graphers are Cornelius Nepos, Plutarch and Aurelius Victor. Some
iacts also relating to him are found in Cicero's Brutus and the treatise
cle senectute.
